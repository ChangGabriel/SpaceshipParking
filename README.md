# SpaceshipParking
This project is part of a scenario-based exercise to create a smart and efficient system for managing the parking of intergalactic spaceships.
The project was implemented in C# using Visual Studio.

## Task Overview
The objective is to implement a portion of the business logic and corresponding test cases to verify the functionality, based on the following specifications:

* Parking Rules:
  * Only one spaceship per parking space
  * The parking facility has 3 floors with 15 spaces each
* Parking Fees:
  * 15 SEK/hour
  * 50 SEK/day for parking exceeding 24 hours

## Use Cases
1. Register Spaceship Parking:
   * Capture details including parking space, registration number, date, and time
2. Register Spaceship Retrieval:
   * Log the retrieval with parking space, registration number, date, and time
   * The system calculates and returns the fee based on parking duration
